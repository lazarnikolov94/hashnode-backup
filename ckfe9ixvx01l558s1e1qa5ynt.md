## Portfolio Beef #1

Hello front-end engineers! Welcome to my first article of my new series Portfolio Beef. I'll be creating a series of free web design templates that you can use to "beef up" your portfolio.

I encourage everyone to duplicate the template, code the website and upload it to Vercel, Netlify, or any other free hosting service. Make sure to keep an eye on all of the details, like colors, border radius, shadows and spacing. Try to make this design as pixel perfect as you can.

If you want to get notified when a new Portfolio Beef comes out, use the subscription box at the top of this post!

I wish you good luck!
